Points of interest:
1. S2_max = 1.95213e-08 at r = 33.0571 is the radius of interest. Here the analytical S makes a jump.
2. f_max = 1.14112e-23 at r = 0.121059


Notes for myself:
1. make an analogy of Lotka-Volterra dynamics
2. what is this r = 33.0571?
3. what's r = 0.121059?
4. why is f not pure zero?
